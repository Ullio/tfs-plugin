<div>
  <p>
    A list of TFS shelvesets to be pulled into the local workspace. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Every entry must carry the name of the shelveset and the name of its owner separated by a colon, i.e. it must be of the form &lt;name&gt;:&lt;owner&gt;.
  <p>
    Multiple entries must be delimited by semicolon characters (';'). Entries can be placed onto separate lines, but still require the delimiter.
